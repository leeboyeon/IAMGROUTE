## Installing / Getting started

[➡ 포팅메뉴얼 바로가기](https://github.com/leeboyeon/iamgroute/blob/79ec5c5fef404fbff48d05d5721eb32c61bcc9bb/exec/%ED%8F%AC%ED%8C%85%20%EB%A7%A4%EB%89%B4%EC%96%BC.md)

## Developing

### Built With
- android compileSdkVersion 30
- android buildToolsVersion 30.0.3
- android minSdkVersion 21
- android targetSdkVersion 30
- Java Version 1.8


### Prerequisites
- android minSdkVer : Oreo 8.0 이상
- android API Level : 26 이상
- Android version 5.0, API 레벨 21도 설치는 가능하나 많은 기능에 제약이 있음.


### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/leeboyeon/iamgroute.git
cd your-project/
packagemanager install
```
Please refer to the [portingmanual](https://github.com/leeboyeon/iamgroute/blob/79ec5c5fef404fbff48d05d5721eb32c61bcc9bb/exec/%ED%8F%AC%ED%8C%85%20%EB%A7%A4%EB%89%B4%EC%96%BC.md) for detailed explanation.
### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing
give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Versioning

We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [link to tags on this repository](/tags).


## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when using the project.
